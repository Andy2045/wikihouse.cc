    <h1>We work for you</h1>
    <p>WikiHouse Foundation is not backed by venture capital. Itâ€™s a small non-profit with a huge mission: to put the knowledge and tools to build low-cost, sustainable homes into commons where they are freely accessible to anyone, and owned by everyone.</p>
    <p>We need your support to achieve that.</p>
    <p>Please help us to keep working for the common good by making a one-off donation, or making a small monthly stipend.</p>
