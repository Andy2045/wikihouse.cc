<p>We receive lots of requests from students  and researchers around the world for interviews and information. Sadly, as a small non-profit, we’re not always able to respond to as many as we’d like. Please make your request as specific as possible. You may also consider getting together a group of friends and lobbying your institution to organise a speaking event / workshop.</p>
