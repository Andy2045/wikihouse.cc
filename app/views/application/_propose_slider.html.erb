            <p>Sited in a beautiful but exposed Scottish valley with breathtaking sea views out towards the isle of Jura,  A-barn was built as a workshop, garage and studio space. It was assembled in a little over a week by the client and a group of volunteers, working with a local builder.</p>

            <p>Janet and Martin wanted to build a permanent home on the site of their nursery business in Warwickshire, UK. Architecture 00 worked with them to design the home around their needs, which they then built for themselves, helped by friends, neighbours, with local builders contracted to install foundations and electrics.</p>
