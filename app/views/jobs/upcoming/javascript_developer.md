## Front-end (JavaScript) developer

#### Necessary skills

* Excellent working knowledge of modern (ES2015) JavaScript - able to write well-organised code using libraries such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org)

* Experience developing websites and forms that can interact with JSON APIs

* Comfortable writing HTML and CSS

* Passion for building interfaces and experiences that are simple and delightful to use

#### Nice-to-haves

* Any experience working on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) projects could be helpful but not essential

Being London-based is not essential, but we're looking for somebody who can attend a meeting or workshop at least once a month.
