## JavaScript developer

#### Necessary skills

* Excellent working knowledge of (ES2015) JavaScript - comfortable writing well-organised, tested code using modern libraries such as React and Redux

* Experience developing websites that can interact with JSON APIs

* Passion for building interfaces and experiences that are simple and delightful to use

* Able to work collaboratively using git
